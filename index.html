<br/><br/>Hi there, I'm Torii!<br/>
<br/>
I’m a web and publicity manager with a passion for graphic design, whether it be web or print. Right now I’m working on finishing my degree, while also loving my first years and hating the mountain of paper work as a residential advisor. As a 2017 graduate from Wesleyan University with a double major in English with a focus in creative writing and Feminist, Gender, & Sexuality Studies, I’m also a versed writer and editor of both journalistic and creative material.

In my free time (or freelance time), I’m just trying to live my life as a Mississippi transplant that loves to get into discussions about low-income issues and whether or not femininity is inherently oppressive. I write anything from poetry and short stories to editorial pieces and essays, and I’m keen to do it on feminism, LGBTQ+ issues, healing, and my own personal experiences. In the past, I’ve contributed to Helloflo, and been featured on Queen Mob’s Teahouse, Femsplain, Vagabond City Lit, Yes Poetry, and The Fem. My other free time is mostly spent taking too many reading-intensive classes, working publicity and graphic design jobs for Wesleyan theater productions, pretending to be funny on Twitter, obsessing over my Spotify playlists, and trying to pet every dog I see.
